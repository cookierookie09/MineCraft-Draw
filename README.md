A minecraft planner HTML app

Ever wanted to plan your mob farm or castle, but didn't want to make a test world?

Now, you can. With the Minecraft Planner, you can build every structure your mind can imagine, all on the web.

How to use the Minecraft Planner:

The minecraft planner is hosted [here](http://thecodewarrior.github.io/MineCraft-Draw/)

Currently the tabs do nothing, but will be for different mods in future versions. 
Blocks are selected by clicking on them in selector, 
they can also be dragged into a slot of the hotbar below the selector for eaiser access. 
Once you have a block selected, click or drag on the grid to place them, 
if you want to erase, either select the eraser block (air), or press the `E` key, 
this will switch to the eraser and allow you to return to the block you were using before by pressing `E` again. 

You can pan the viewer by clicking the arrows sorrunding the green dot. Moving between vertical layers is achived by 
clicking the arrows above and below the box with the layer number. The two fields to the right of the navigator are 
the viewport size controls.

Right clicking on any block will show you a context menu, the menu can have custom icons for each block. 
By default, the context menu has two icons, the gear icon, which will open up the edit pane for that block, 
and the eyedropper, which will allow you to place exact duplicates of that block.

The edit pane is used to change the direction a block faces and for any settings the block has setup. 
Click `Point` and click on a face to point the block, if you want to cancel, click on a red face 
(a face the block isn't allowed to point) or on the face the block is already pointing.

The tool keyboard shortcuts are:
  - `E`: eraser toggle
  - `I`: eyedropper
  - `F`: paint bucket

The minecraft planner is built with mods in mind, so once it is implemented, any mod you can imagine can be supported.
